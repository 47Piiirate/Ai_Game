# Debugging Guide for Metroidvania Game

## Current Issues

1. **Missing Sound Files**: The game is trying to load sound files that don't exist
2. **Image Loading Error**: An error occurs with message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_rect'`

## How to Fix These Issues

### 1. Create Missing Sound Files

Run the following scripts to create the necessary sound directories and placeholder sound files:

```bash
# Create directory structure
python create_sound_directories.py

# Create placeholder sound files
python create_placeholder_sounds.py
```

This will create empty WAV files that can be replaced with actual sound effects later.

### 2. Debug Image Loading Issues

To identify which image is causing the NoneType error:

```bash
python debug_image_loading.py
```

This script will check all images in the Sprites directory and report which ones failed to load properly.

## Next Steps

1. After identifying the problematic image(s), you can:
   - Check if the file exists
   - Check if the file is corrupted
   - Check if the file path in your code matches the actual file location
   - Replace the file with a valid image

2. Once you've fixed the issues, try running the game again:
```bash
python launch_game.py
```

## Common Causes for 'NoneType' Errors

1. Image file doesn't exist at the specified path
2. Image file is corrupt or in an unsupported format
3. Incorrect file paths in code
4. Running the game from a directory where relative paths don't resolve correctly
